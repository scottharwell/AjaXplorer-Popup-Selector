This is an attempt to create a plugin for Ajaxplorer that will allow you to create a form button to find a file on your server.
The purpose of this plugin is to create something similar to CKFinder's "popup" functionality with Ajaxplorer.

INSTRUCTIONS

To use this plugin: 

	1) Place the hook.popupchooser in your ajaxsplorer plugin directory.
	2) In your javascript (either inline or the file you are using to define your functions) create a callback function.
		-The function should be named 'ajaxplorerPopupCallback'
		-The body of the function should do what you want with the image path (such as set an input value)
	
	function ajaxplorerPopupCallback(filePath){
		$('.imagepath').val(filePath);
	}
		
	3) Create a function to popup the window:
		-The externa;_selector_type options must be set to popup
		-The relative_path parameter must be set and it must point to the ajaxplorer folder that stores your files
	
	function chooseFile(){
		var fbWindow = window.open(
		"/ajaxplorer/?external_selector_type=popup&relative_path=/files/",
		"ajaxplorer",
		width=600,
		height=500
	);
